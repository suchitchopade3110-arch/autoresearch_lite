# Autoresearch Lite

[![Tests](https://github.com/suchitchopade3110-arch/autoresearch_lite/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/suchitchopade3110-arch/autoresearch_lite/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

An autonomous ML research agent loop: propose a candidate (as a diff), apply and commit it on its own git branch, run it in a sandbox against progressively larger subsets of a dataset, and merge or roll back based on the result - with RAG-style memory of past attempts, a human-approval gate before any merge, crash recovery, and, optionally, a concurrent evolutionary search over a population of candidates per generation.

## What's implemented

- **Orchestrator (`orchestrator/run.py`):** two modes.
  - `--mode sequential` (default): one candidate at a time; loops up to `orchestrator.max_iterations`, stopping early once `target_score` is reached or `patience` iterations pass with no improvement.
  - `--mode evolutionary`: a population of candidates per generation, evaluated concurrently and evolved via `evolution/population.py`'s `EvolutionEngine` (selection, mutation-by-prompt, Pareto/weighted scoring, adaptive population sizing, all seeded for reproducibility via `evolution.random_seed`).
  - A `cleanup` subcommand (`python -m orchestrator.run cleanup --config ...`) reclaims state left behind by a run that crashed or was killed - orphaned candidate worktrees/branches and approval requests stuck pending past their deadline. It also runs automatically at the start of every `run` invocation, and `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` exit cleanly instead of leaving a traceback.
- **Config validation (`config_schema.py`):** the config file is validated against a pydantic schema at load time - a malformed or missing `eval.stages` (which would otherwise let every candidate pass evaluation with a score of 0.0) is rejected up front with a readable error, not discovered deep inside a run.
- **Human-approval gate (`approval/`):** every candidate that passes evaluation is held pending a human decision before it merges - in either mode. The gate defaults to *required* even if the config is missing the `approval` section entirely or has a malformed value in it (see `approval/gate.py:resolve_approval_config`); only an explicit, valid `approval.enabled: false` disables it. A timeout with no decision is recorded as a real, persisted "timed_out" outcome and never merges - it is not treated as approval. In evolutionary mode, every candidate in a generation gets its approval request created up front (so a reviewer sees the whole generation together) before any of them are awaited, so a human is never a bottleneck on the sandbox pool. Decisions are stored in SQLite (`approvals.db`), so they survive a restart and are visible to both the orchestrator process and the dashboard process.
- **Dashboard + API (`api/main.py`):** a FastAPI app serving a small Tailwind-styled page (auto-refreshing, no separate frontend build) to review and approve/reject pending candidates, plus JSON endpoints (`/api/pending`, `/api/approvals`, `/api/history`, `/api/report`). It reads directly from the same ChromaDB store, approval database, and `evolution_report.jsonl` the orchestrator writes to - there's no separate/forked data store to drift out of sync. Protected by HTTP Basic Auth (fail-safe: required unless explicitly disabled) and a double-submit-cookie CSRF token on the approve/reject forms - see [Dashboard security](#dashboard-security) below.
- **Report generator (`reporting/report_generator.py`):** `compute_kpis()` is the single function both the dashboard and the end-of-run report (`reports/latest_report.md`, written automatically when a run finishes) call - so the two surfaces can't independently recompute the same numbers differently. Tracks merge rate, duplicate-avoidance rate, compute cost per improvement, and approval outcomes.
- **Git State Controller (`vcs/git_controller.py`):** every candidate gets its own `git worktree`, so branching, committing, merging, and rolling back a candidate never touches the caller's main checkout (or any uncommitted work in it) - and concurrent candidates in the evolutionary path never share a checkout with each other. A merge rebases the candidate onto the target branch inside its own worktree first, then advances the target ref with a compare-and-swap `git update-ref` - never a `git checkout`/`git merge` in the caller's working tree, so it can neither switch whatever branch the caller has checked out (when `base_ref` names a different one) nor crash on a dirty working tree. A conflict (in the rebase, or in the compare-and-swap if the ref moved concurrently) raises `MergeConflict` (recorded as a distinct `conflict` outcome) rather than ever leaving the shared checkout mid-merge. `target.repo_path`/`target.base_ref` let the repo under evolution be a separate checkout from this harness's own repository, and the controller survives a detached HEAD instead of crashing.
- **Diff-scope guard (`vcs/diff_guard.py`):** every candidate-generated diff is checked BEFORE it ever reaches `git apply` - a diff that touches any path outside `target.files`, creates a symlink, or changes a permission bit/renames/copies a file is refused outright, with a real reason recorded. `git apply` itself has no concept of "only these files are authorized"; without this, a diff could rewrite the harness's own evaluation code, or turn a sandbox output directory into a symlink escaping to an arbitrary host path.
- **Crash recovery (`vcs/git_controller.py:cleanup_orphans`, `approval/store.py:timeout_stale_requests`):** a previous run that was killed mid-flight leaves candidate worktrees/branches and possibly a pending approval behind; both are reclaimed automatically at startup (or via the `cleanup` subcommand) rather than accumulating indefinitely.
- **Structured logging (`observability/logging_config.py`):** JSON logs to stdout, with `run_id` (and `candidate_id`, where applicable) bound to every record, so a run's log lines can be correlated and filtered without parsing free-text.
- **Execution Sandbox (`sandbox/executor.py`):** runs each candidate in Docker as a non-root user, with `--network none`, a read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities, `--pids-limit` (fork-bomb protection), a per-process open-file-descriptor `--ulimit`, a size-capped `/tmp` tmpfs, and the existing CPU/memory limits and wall-clock timeout.
- **Real evaluation pipeline (`eval/dataset.py`, `eval/pipeline.py`):** a deterministic synthetic dataset (a noisy linear boundary), split into `train.jsonl`/`test.jsonl` (both mounted read-only into the sandbox) and `truth.json` (the held-out labels - stays on the host, never mounted). The generator's own seed is a fresh, secret, host-only value by default (`eval/dataset.py:generate_split`) - not the codebase's own public default - so a candidate can't sidestep `truth.json` entirely by replaying the (also public) generator code itself; brute-forcing the seed from a mounted `train.jsonl` row is infeasible inside the sandbox's own CPU/time limits. A candidate reads `TRAIN_PATH`/`TEST_PATH`/`SUBSET_PERCENTAGE`, but that env var is only informational - each stage's `TRAIN_PATH` is a HOST-SELECTED subset file (`eval/dataset.py:write_subset`), so a candidate that ignores it (or claims a smaller subset than it actually used) physically cannot see more rows than its stage allots, not just dishonestly claim to have used fewer. `TEST_PATH` stays the whole test set at every stage, so scores remain comparable across stages. A candidate writes real predictions to `/app/out/predictions.jsonl`, which `EvalPipeline.score_predictions()` scores against `truth.json` (opened with a symlink check and a size cap, so a candidate can't turn that host-side read into a denial of service either). A printed `SCORE:` line is parsed only as a diagnostic to flag a mismatch between what the candidate claims and its real score - it is never trusted for gating, so a candidate cannot buy a merge by printing a perfect score claim (see `tests/test_reward_hacking.py`). A merge also requires beating the best-known score for that stage by `eval.min_improvement` (`eval/baseline.py`), not just clearing the stage's absolute threshold - including in evolutionary mode, where the baseline is re-checked and a rebased candidate re-evaluated immediately before it actually finalizes, not just once during its own generation's initial scoring pass (`evolution/scheduler.py`).
- **Experiment Memory (RAG) (`memory/db.py`):** a local ChromaDB instance storing hypotheses, diffs, outcomes, metrics, and rationale per experiment (cosine distance, so `evolution/duplicate_checker.py`'s similarity threshold is meaningful). An exact-diff repeat is caught via a cheap metadata lookup (`has_exact_diff`) before paying for an embedding + nearest-neighbor search.
- **Failure Analysis (`memory/failure_analysis.py`):** categorizes failures (syntax, runtime, timeout, resource-limit, metric-regression).
- **Prompt Builder (`generation/prompt_builder.py`):** retrieves past successes/failures from memory into the next prompt.
- **Patch Generation (`generation/patch_generator.py`):** validates and applies unified diffs against `LLMClient.generate_diff(prompt, target_file, current_content)` - every call includes the target file's real current content, so a real model writes a diff against what's actually there rather than a stale assumption. Three implementations: `MockLLMClient` (default, no network/key needed - always implements the same honest baseline solution), `AnthropicClient` (`generation.client: anthropic` in config; reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment, never from config), and `LocalLLMClient` (`generation.client: local`; talks to an OpenAI-compatible local server - Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp, ... - via `generation.base_url`, no key needed). Both real clients retry up to 3 times on a `git apply --check` failure, feeding the actual stderr back into the next prompt, and record `input_tokens`/`output_tokens`/`estimated_cost_usd` into every candidate's metrics and the end-of-run report (`estimated_cost_usd` is always `0.0` for `LocalLLMClient` - local inference has no per-token billing).
- **Static Analysis Pre-check (`generation/static_check.py`):** rejects malformed/invalid syntax before sandbox execution.
- **Multi-objective scoring (`evolution/scoring.py`):** a candidate's real evaluation score drives selection, and a failed candidate can never outrank a successful one under either scoring strategy regardless of how fast it failed.

## What's NOT implemented yet

- **`MockLLMClient` always returns the same diff regardless of prompt/history.** This is deliberate - it's the zero-setup default with no network or API key needed, not a bug. Set `generation.client: anthropic` or `generation.client: local` for a real, context-aware model.
- **Carbon-footprint methodology.** `energy_estimate` is `execution_time * energy_watts_constant` (an arbitrary multiplier, default 10.0), not a real methodology like CodeCarbon or a grid-intensity constant - it's a placeholder signal for relative comparison between candidates, not an absolute measurement.

## Security Disclaimer

The sandbox runs candidates as a non-root user, with `--network none`, a read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities, a `--pids-limit`, a per-process file-descriptor `--ulimit`, a size-capped `/tmp` tmpfs, and standard Docker `--cpus`/`--memory` limits plus a wall-clock timeout via `subprocess`. This meaningfully raises the bar against a candidate trying to exfiltrate data, persist state, exhaust the host's process table, or exceed its resource limits. **It still does NOT provide hardened security against zero-days, container escapes, or a deliberately adversarial kernel exploit.** Do not execute untrusted malware in this sandbox.

## Dashboard security

The dashboard is fail-safe like the approval gate: **authentication is required unless explicitly disabled.**

- Set `DASHBOARD_USERNAME` and `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` in the environment to enable HTTP Basic Auth on every route (the page and every `/api/*` endpoint).
- If neither is set and auth hasn't been explicitly disabled, every request is rejected (401) - there's no way to authenticate, so nobody gets in. This is deliberate: an unauthenticated dashboard that can approve merges into your codebase should never be reachable by default.
- For local/single-user use where this is unnecessary, set `DASHBOARD_AUTH_DISABLED=true` explicitly.
- The approve/reject forms carry a CSRF token (double-submit cookie pattern) - a POST without a matching token is rejected (403), regardless of auth, so a cross-site auto-submitting form can't trigger an approval using a browser's cached credentials.

## How to run locally

### Prerequisites

- Docker must be installed and running.
- Python 3.9+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 1. Start the dashboard (in its own terminal)

```bash
# Local/single-user use:
DASHBOARD_AUTH_DISABLED=true uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# Or, to require a login:
DASHBOARD_USERNAME=admin DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=change-me uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` to see pending approvals and run history. Leave this running - the orchestrator will block waiting for decisions made here.

### 2. Run the orchestrator (sequential mode)

```bash
python -m orchestrator.run --config configs/example.yaml --goal "Improve model performance"
# optional: --max-iterations 10 --target-score 0.9 --patience 3
```

Each candidate that passes evaluation shows up on the dashboard; approve or reject it there. No decision within `approval.timeout_seconds` (default 30 minutes) holds it - it will not merge.

### Evolutionary mode

```bash
python -m orchestrator.run --config configs/example.yaml --goal "Improve model performance" --mode evolutionary
```

Every candidate that passes evaluation in every generation gets its own pending approval, resolved independently and concurrently. Writes `evolution_report.jsonl` (one line per generation), stores every candidate's outcome in ChromaDB (`chroma_db/`), and writes `reports/latest_report.md` when the run finishes.

### Recovering from a crash

```bash
python -m orchestrator.run cleanup --config configs/example.yaml
```

Removes any candidate worktrees/branches left behind by a run that was killed or crashed, and times out any approval request that's been pending past its deadline with nobody left to resolve it. Runs automatically at the start of every `run` invocation too, so this is mainly useful to run standalone after a crash without immediately starting a new run.

### Running without a human present (e.g. CI, demos)

Set `approval.enabled: false` explicitly in your config. This is an intentional, visible override, not a silent default - the shipped `configs/example.yaml` defaults to `enabled: true` and requires a human decision.

### Separating the harness from the code under evolution

By default, `target.repo_path` is `.` - candidates are generated directly into this harness's own repository. To evolve a separate codebase instead (recommended for anything beyond local experimentation), point `target.repo_path` at that repository's checkout; the orchestrator warns at startup if it resolves back to the harness's own directory.

### Swapping in a real LLM

Set `generation.client: anthropic` in your config and export `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - see `generation/patch_generator.py:AnthropicClient`.

To run against a local model instead - no API key, no per-token cost, but expect a higher malformed-diff retry rate than a frontier model - set `generation.client: local` and point `generation.base_url` at an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp server, ...); see `generation/patch_generator.py:LocalLLMClient`. A code-tuned model (e.g. Qwen2.5-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder) will apply far more reliably than a general chat model.

To use a different provider, implement the `LLMClient` interface:

```python
class MyRealLLMClient(LLMClient):
    def generate_diff(self, prompt: str, target_file: str, current_content: str) -> str:
        # Call your API here and return the string unified diff
        return api.call(prompt, current_content)
```

### Config Schema (`configs/example.yaml`)

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

Most test files are pure Python and need no Docker. `test_sandbox.py` and `test_integration*.py` build and run the Docker sandbox image and require Docker to be running (the one exception is `test_sandbox.py`'s `test_docker_run_command_includes_resource_hardening_flags`, which mocks `subprocess.run` and needs no daemon). CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) runs the full suite, including these, on every push and pull request against `main`.
